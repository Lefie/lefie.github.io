## GSAP Exploration Project 
In this project, I created a sequence of animations and store it as a tween. I created a button such that upon clicking the button, the tween, the sequence of animations would play. 

I explored techniques such as the use of GSAP's `onComplete` function to chain
several animations together. I have yet to learn Timeline and I am sure that would've been the 
cleaner way to approach it. I also explored using the `stagger` property to reveal the three words, "Faith",
"Hope" and "Charity". I used the `yoyo` property to keep the animation playing in sequence and reverse. 


I love when the small creative inspirations comes at me : Initially, the project is just a static page of the words "Faith Hope Charity". I created a mask, which was intended to be layered on top of the text initially. But the mask ended up becoming a progress bar. I added a button as the trigger that sets off the animation. Then once the text is revealed, I decided to make them appear "floating" in the screen as opposed to staying still. 

I am happy about how it turned out, although there are improvements to be made. For instance, I could make the interaction with the button better, such that upon clicking on the button, the button doesn't disappear abruptly.
