# Month of October
October is known as Mary's Month in the Catholic Church. In addition to its Marian nature, the Church
also celebrates many of its beloved Saints. Just a little over a month ago, the Church welcomed two newly 
Cannonized Saints, one of which has his feast day on October 12th - St.Carlo Acutis. I thought to make a little art gallery showcasing some of my beloved saints from the month of October. 

The technology used for this project is GSAP again, specifically focusing on its `scrollTrigger` functionality which lets the users scroll to a certain point which then sets off the animation. The animation can be reversed and replayed depending on the scroll positions.
