            <p class="explanation1">Our Lady of the Rosary, previously known as Our Lady of Victory, 
                was established by Pope Pius V after the Church's victory against the Turks at Lepanto on October 7th, 1571. 
                The Pope had mobilized the Church to pray the rosaries, asking Our Lady for her intercessions during the battle. Upon battle victory, Pope Pius V 
                attributed the victory to the rosaries prayed for that intention on that day.</p>

            <p class="explanation2"> The Dominican Order has a special love for the rosary. Depicted in the image to the left is St.Dominic, 
                the founder of the Dominican Order, receiving a vision of Mary who told him to preach the Holy Rosary. Because of this, Dominicans
                celebrate Our Lady of Rosary by remembering Our Lady's special love for the Dominican Order by entrusting the preaching of the rosary to the order.   </p>
