## The Rosary Project 
On October 7th, Catholics around the world observed the Feast of Our Lady of Rosary. 
Inspired by the significance of the feast in the Catholic Church, I thought to make 
a small rosary project to honor this feast, gives some context as to where the feast comes 
from, and also what the rosary consists of, namely the mysteries. 

I started drawing some animation sequences on paper using pens. I had an idea of what the overall sequence
would look like. When user visits the page, the first thing they will see is the title `Our Lady of Rosary` 
with an image of St.Dominic receiving the rosary from Mary. Then the image shrinks in size. And then each different 
mystery follows and comes in from the sides. 

Again, I love when spontaneous creative inspirations pop up as I am coding. I decided to give each mystery a different color invoking different feelings. A spontanous design choice I made was to allow the background of the 
mystery container to change in color when a user hovers over a particular mystery. For instance, if I hover over 
the sorrowful mystery which has a dark blue background, then the color of the big container also changes to align 
with the background color of the sorrowful mystery, highlighting the mystery which is currently being hovered over. I
also made it scale in size to further highlight which mystery it is the user is currently looking at. 

I added the text explanation besides the image at the end. I used the mask technique to let texts come in from the side.
